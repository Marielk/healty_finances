# Healthy Finances

## About this proyect 🚀

This is an App that determines the level of indebtedness of the user through machine learning, identifying different profiles, this in order to propose a personalized plan that invites and accompanies people to meet their financial goals, whether they are be out of over-indebtedness or Avoid falling into it.
Maintaining healthy levels of indebtedness allows people to improve their quality of life, reduce poverty and also allows them to access other products and services.
We seek to predict, determine and reduce the level of indebtedness, since currently in Chile families have a debt equivalent to 73.3% of their disposable income, this exceeds the recommended percentage of healthy indebtedness, which is 40%.
